# Research Findings

## Ongoing Study: Autonomous AI Agent Behavior in the Wild

We are currently running a fleet of Sundew honeypot instances in the cloud, each configured with a unique deployment persona to maximize coverage and prevent cross-instance fingerprinting. We're intentionally keeping deployment details vague for obvious reasons.

Every instance mimics a different type of production service. The persona engine ensures no two deployments share response structures, endpoint naming, timing characteristics, or error formats.

### What We're Measuring

- **Discovery patterns** - How do AI agents find and identify target services?
- **Reconnaissance behavior** - What do agents do in the first 30 seconds after connecting?
- **Exploitation sequences** - What attack chains do autonomous agents attempt?
- **Tool use patterns** - Which MCP tools do agents invoke, and in what order?
- **Evasion techniques** - Do agents attempt to detect or avoid honeypots?
- **Cross-instance correlation** - Can agents recognize two Sundew instances as the same software?

### Data Collection Pipeline

All instances stream structured telemetry to a centralized analysis cluster. Every HTTP request, MCP tool invocation, and credential access attempt is logged with full request/response bodies, timing data, and behavioral metadata.

The raw dataset will be published alongside the findings for reproducibility.

### Status

<Info>
  Data collection is actively underway. We are allowing sufficient time to gather a statistically meaningful sample across all persona types and trap configurations before publishing results.
</Info>

We plan to share the full findings here once the study concludes, including anonymized datasets, behavioral taxonomies, and detection heuristics. Preliminary results will be presented at **DEF CON**.
