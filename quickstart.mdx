## Install

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Docker (recommended)">
    ```bash
    docker compose up
    ```
    Pulls the latest image and starts Sundew with a randomly generated persona.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="pip">
    ```bash
    pip install sundewsh
    sundew serve
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="From source">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sundew-sh/sundew.git
    cd sundew && make run
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Sundew is now running on `http://localhost:8080` with a randomly generated persona.

## Explore what's running

Open a second terminal and see what AI agents would discover:

```bash
# AI plugin manifest
curl http://localhost:8080/.well-known/ai-plugin.json

# OpenAPI spec
curl http://localhost:8080/openapi.json

# Hit a persona-generated endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v2/transactions
```

Every response is shaped by the persona. A different deployment would have completely different endpoints, company names, and data.

## Query captured sessions

After traffic has flowed through:

```bash
# See the most recent session
sundew query --last-session

# Filter for AI agent traffic
sundew query --type ai_agent --last 24h

# Quick stats
sundew stats
```

## Use with Claude (MCP)

Add Sundew as an MCP server to query your honeypot data directly from Claude:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sundew": {
      "command": "sundew",
      "args": ["mcp-client"]
    }
  }
}
```
